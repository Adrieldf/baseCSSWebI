Base starter includes the latest version of Base to get you started.

Base starter is powered by ParcelJS which compiles SCSS with live reload support, optimises images, compiles and minifies CSS/JS.

There are a series of npm scripts that can perform all the above tasks in a single action. Below is a list of all the npm scripts within the Base Starter package.json.

| NPM Task | Outcome |
| -------- | ------- |
| `npm start` | Starts up a web server and watches for HTML, SCSS and JS changes within `/src` |
| `npm run build` | The build task optmises your website for production |
